# Multi-Display Support Test Guide

## What's New
Multi-display support has been fully implemented! The system now:

1. **Detects all connected displays** - The app enumerates all screens and provides their info to the LLM
2. **Understands display references** - You can say "external monitor", "second display", "main screen", etc.
3. **Supports display parameters** - All window commands now accept a display index
4. **Shows display info in context** - The LLM knows which windows are on which displays

## Test Commands

### Basic Display Commands
- "Put Safari on my external monitor"
- "Move Terminal to the second display"
- "Open Xcode on display 1"
- "Snap Messages to the right side of my external monitor"

### Display-Aware Positioning
- "Put Safari on the left half of my external monitor"
- "Center Finder on my main display"
- "Cascade all windows on display 1"
- "Tile windows on my second screen"

### Natural Language
- "Move this to my other screen"
- "Put everything on my laptop display"
- "Arrange coding setup on external monitor"

## Debug Output
When you run commands, you'll see:
```
📱 Display Configuration: 0: Built-in Retina Display (1920x1080) - Main, 1: External Display (2560x1440)
🎯 SNAPPING: Safari
  📱 Target Display: 1 - External Display
  📐 Display bounds: {{0, 0}, {2560, 1440}}
  📍 Position: left, Size: half
  📏 Calculated bounds: {0, 0} size: {1280, 1440}
```

## Testing Steps
1. Connect an external monitor
2. Open WindowAI from Xcode
3. Use the hotkey (⌘+⇧+Space)
4. Try the test commands above
5. Watch the console output for display information

## What to Look For
- Display detection (should show all connected displays)
- Correct display index mapping (0 = main, 1 = external, etc.)
- Windows actually moving to the specified display
- Proper bounds calculation for each display's resolution

## Troubleshooting
- If display commands don't work, check console for display enumeration
- Verify display indices match your setup
- Check that window bounds are within the target display's frame
