üß™ WINDOWAI CASCADE LAYOUT TESTING GUIDE
=======================================

The WindowAI cascade layout system has been completely overhauled to be truly dynamic and archetype-based.
Here are various commands to test with the running WindowAI app:

CODING CONTEXTS (Focus should go to IDE)
----------------------------------------
1. "i want to code"
   - Expected: Xcode/Cursor/VS Code gets focus and primary position
   - Terminal gets ‚â§30% width on the right
   - Browser cascades with proper overlap

2. "let me develop a python script"
   - Works with ANY IDE (not just Xcode)
   - Should focus the code editor, not Terminal

3. "time to program in swift"
   - Archetype-based: any .codeWorkspace app gets priority

DESIGN CONTEXTS (Focus should go to design tool)
------------------------------------------------
4. "let's design a new interface"
   - Figma/Sketch gets focus and primary position
   - Browser cascades for reference
   - Chat apps as side columns if present

5. "create some mockups"
   - Design tool takes primary space
   - Supporting apps cascade appropriately

RESEARCH CONTEXTS (Focus should go to browser)
----------------------------------------------
6. "research machine learning papers"
   - Browser gets focus and primary position
   - Note-taking app cascades
   - Terminal as side column if needed

7. "browse documentation for react"
   - Browser-centric layout
   - Code editor cascades if present

COMMUNICATION CONTEXTS (Focus should go to chat)
-----------------------------------------------
8. "collaborate on slack"
   - Slack/Discord gets focus
   - Browser for reference
   - Other apps minimize or side column

9. "join the team meeting"
   - Video app gets primary focus
   - Chat as side support

TESTING DIFFERENT APP COMBINATIONS
----------------------------------
The system now works with ANY apps, not hardcoded names:

10. IntelliJ IDEA + Firefox + iTerm2
11. VS Code + Chrome + Warp
12. Cursor + Brave + Hyper
13. WebStorm + Safari + Console
14. Sublime Text + Edge + Terminal

KEY IMPROVEMENTS TO OBSERVE
---------------------------
‚úÖ NO HARDCODING: Works with any app combination
‚úÖ ARCHETYPE-BASED: Apps classified by behavior, not name
‚úÖ CONTEXT-AWARE: Focus goes to the right app type
‚úÖ PROPER SIZING: Terminal ‚â§30%, browsers ‚â•35%
‚úÖ CASCADE OVERLAP: Apps peek out, no wasted space
‚úÖ DYNAMIC POSITIONS: Based on focused archetype

DEBUG OUTPUT TO WATCH FOR
-------------------------
When you run commands, you'll see:

üéØ ARCHETYPE-BASED CASCADE LAYOUT:
  üì± Apps: Terminal, Arc, Xcode
  üì± Terminal ‚Üí Text Stream
  üì± Arc ‚Üí Content Canvas
  üì± Xcode ‚Üí Code Workspace
  üéØ Focused archetype: Code Workspace
  üìù Context: 'coding'
  üéØ User intent: 'i want to code'
  üîç Focus resolution for context 'coding':
    üì± Terminal: text_stream (priority 3)
    üì± Arc: content_canvas (priority 2)
    üì± Xcode: code_workspace (priority 1)
  üéØ Focus resolved to: Xcode

This shows the intelligent focus resolution working correctly!

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If layouts still seem wrong:
1. Check that WindowAI app is using the latest build
2. Ensure the LLM is receiving the user_intent parameter
3. Watch the debug output for focus resolution
4. Verify apps are being classified correctly by archetype

The cascade system is now truly intelligent and adaptable!
