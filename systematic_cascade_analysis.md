# ðŸŽ¯ SYSTEMATIC CASCADE ANALYSIS

## Current Status âœ…
- **Terminal positioning**: FIXED - now appears correctly on right side
- **Terminal sizing**: FIXED - now 20% width (288px) instead of 55% (800px)  
- **App matching**: FIXED - arrangements matched by name, not index

## Remaining Issues to Address Systematically

### 1. Context Detection Issues
**Problem**: Context still shows 'general' instead of 'coding'
- Should extract "coding" from "i want to code"
- Affects app filtering and prioritization

### 2. App Selection Issues  
**Problem**: May still be selecting wrong apps or wrong quantities
- Need to verify optimal app selection for coding context
- Ensure Cursor > Xcode priority in all contexts

### 3. Cursor Positioning Issues
**Problem**: Cursor may not be getting optimal primary position
- Should dominate left side as primary workspace
- Should get ~70% width for coding context

### 4. Arc Positioning Issues
**Problem**: Arc peek positioning may not be optimal
- Should peek intelligently without blocking primary workspace
- Should maintain functional width

### 5. Overall Layout Coherence
**Problem**: Windows may not form coherent cascade layout
- Should create flowing, accessible arrangement
- Should respect your "no hardcoded rules" principle

## Systematic Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Context Detection Verification
- Test if "i want to code" â†’ "coding" context extraction works
- Verify context affects app filtering correctly

### Phase 2: App Selection Verification  
- Test if correct apps are selected for coding context
- Verify app priorities (Cursor > Xcode, etc.)

### Phase 3: Positioning Verification
- Test each app gets intended position/size
- Verify no overlaps or poor arrangements

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
- Test complete "i want to code" flow end-to-end
- Verify final layout matches vision

## Next Steps
1. Run comprehensive diagnostic to identify ALL remaining issues
2. Create systematic fixes for each category
3. Test holistically, not piecemeal
4. Ensure dynamic system with NO hardcoded rules
